  <h2>ABOUT</h2>

  <p> Originally from Nokomis, Il. I was raised on a farm with my crazy family.
      Homeschooled and lacking attention, as the middle child does, I spent much of my free time being creative.
      I wrote plays, drew constantly, made crafts, crocheted, and built a few minecraft houses.
      Now as I study in college I'm learning how to use my talents to create websites, logos, and other illustrations.
